# Rupert's Drop Pattern Demonstration in C#

This repository demonstrates the Rupert's Drop Pattern using a hypothetical scenario of a Smart Home Security System.

## Concept

The Rupert's Drop Pattern is inspired by the unique physical properties of a Prince Rupert's Drop. The pattern emphasizes the importance of protecting a system's most vulnerable point, akin to the tail of a Rupert's Drop, while ensuring the robustness of its other components.

## Implementation

### Robust Component (Bulbous End)

```csharp
public class SecurityDevice
{
    public void Monitor()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Security device is monitoring...");
    }
}
